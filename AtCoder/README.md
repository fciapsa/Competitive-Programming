## AtCoder

C++ source code with solutions to problems from the online judge [AtCoder] is provided. Submissions received `ACCEPTED` verdict from the judge. If you suspect a solution has bugs, the test cases weren't strong enough to detect them, but that is a rare scenario.

If you are not familiar with Competitive Programming, keep in mind **no software engineering good practices are followed in this context**. The main goal is to code as fast as possible a solution that solves the problem under the given time and input size constraints. This code is hardly ever reviewed, so don't expect it to be pretty.

I'm constantly learning to solve problems! Even though some solutions may be far from ideal they should point you in the right direction.
